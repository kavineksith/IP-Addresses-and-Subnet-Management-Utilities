# IPv6 Subnet Calculator

A comprehensive, industrial-strength IPv6 subnet and address analysis tool designed for engineers, sysadmins, researchers, and security professionals. This tool provides precise breakdowns, transformations, and insights into IPv6 addresses, whether entered individually or in bulk.


## üìå Features

- ‚úÖ Full IPv6 address parsing and validation  
- ‚úÖ CIDR-based subnet calculations  
- ‚úÖ Output in JSON, CSV, or plain text  
- ‚úÖ Converts IPv6 to binary, decimal, and hexadecimal  
- ‚úÖ Determines address types (e.g., global, private, multicast)  
- ‚úÖ Batch mode for processing multiple addresses with threading  
- ‚úÖ Interactive CLI for real-time use  
- ‚úÖ Logging with configurable levels

## üöÄ Usage

### Single IPv6 Address

```bash
./ipv6_calculator.py --ip "2001:db8::/64" --output-format json
```

### From File (Batch Processing)

```bash
./ipv6_calculator.py --file ipv6_list.txt --output-format csv --save
```

### Interactive Mode

```bash
./ipv6_calculator.py
```

Follow the on-screen prompts to process individual addresses or batch files.
