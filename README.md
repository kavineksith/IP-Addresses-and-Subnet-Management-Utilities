# Network Calculator Suite

A comprehensive collection of network calculation tools for IPv4 and IPv6 addressing, subnetting, and CIDR notation conversions.

## üì¶ Toolset Overview

1. **CIDR Notation Converter**
   - Convert between subnet masks, CIDR notation, and IP ranges
   - Supports both interactive and CLI modes
   - IPv4 focused with IPv6 scaffolding

2. **IPv4 Subnet Calculator**
   - Calculate subnets by network count or host requirements
   - Detailed network analysis and reporting
   - JSON, CSV, and text output formats

3. **IPv6 Subnet Calculator**
   - Full IPv6 address parsing and validation
   - CIDR-based subnet calculations
   - Address type detection and conversions

## üöÄ Features

- **Dual-mode operation**: Interactive shell and command-line interface
- **Batch processing**: Handle multiple IPs/subnets simultaneously
- **Multiple output formats**: JSON, CSV, plain text
- **Comprehensive logging**: Debug and audit all operations
- **Threaded processing**: Optimized performance for large datasets
- **Robust validation**: Graceful handling of invalid inputs

## üìã Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/network-calculators.git
cd network-calculators
```

**Requirements**: Python 3.10+

## üõ†Ô∏è Usage

### CIDR Notation Converter
```bash
python cidr.py [subnet-mask|subnet|ip-range] <input> [--output file.json]
```

### IPv4 Subnet Calculator
```bash
python ipv4_calculator.py <network_ip/prefix> (--networks N | --hosts H) [--output json|csv|txt]
```

### IPv6 Subnet Calculator
```bash
python ipv6_calculator.py --ip "2001:db8::/64" [--output-format json|csv|txt]
```

For interactive mode, run any script without arguments.

## üìÑ Sample Outputs

**CIDR Conversion**:
```json
{
  "input": "255.255.255.0",
  "type": "subnet_mask",
  "cidr_notation": "/24",
  "ip_version": "IPV4"
}
```

**IPv4 Subnet Calculation**:
```json
{
  "network": "192.168.1.0/24",
  "subnets": 8,
  "new_prefix": "/27",
  "subnet_details": [...]
}
```

**IPv6 Address Analysis**:
```json
{
  "address": "2001:db8::1",
  "type": "Global Unicast",
  "binary": "0010000000000001...",
  "subnet": "2001:db8::/64"
}
```
